# Car Manufacturing Design Problem

It is the future. Most of our jobs have been replaced by robots. Countries are run by sentient Als and infrastructure, and agriculture is handled completely by robots. The only jobs that humans can get are as programmers. And all of the code they write is for the robots to do their jobs better. Car manufacturers were the last ones to switch completely to robots. That is why they're still figuring out a lot of things. They want to automate the assembly of a car.

You have been tasked with accomplishing this. The codebase is partially implemented. Your job is to design the car assembly module. Your solution needs to be object-oriented, which means you can write classes/interfaces/abstract classes or whichever practice seems right to you. Once you're done designing the classes, the architecture should at least provide solutions to the followings:

- Assemble cars
- Provide details on the Make/Model/Variant of each car
- Keep inventory of assembled cars
- List the features of a car
- Bonus: Given a feature, output the number of cars that have that feature

To assemble a car, the following are required, you can increase the scope if you want however the following must:

- Make/Model (Mercedes/S Class, Dodge/Charger, etc.)
- Body Type(Sedan, SUV, Hatchback)
- Engine Type(V1 to V8)
- Engine CC (1000, 1300, 1500, etc)
- Paint Color (Could be any color)
- Transmission (Auto, Manual)
- Features (Cruise Control, Heated Seats, Self Driving, etc. Each car can have multiple features)

You can take any creative liberties that you can think but you also need to ensure that the criteria defined above are met. Moreover, if you need to make any assumptions, please make sure to clearly mention them.

## About this question

- This is an open ended question that will evaluate your OOP, data structures and general design skills.
- You can write your assumptions in your code comments

There are no test cases for this program. So, no need to read anything from a file.

## Your Answer

- Provide a running code with classes and functions
- Provide some test code to mimic different scenarios defined above
- Your code MUST be executable, otherwise it won't be submitted
- No need to save any data to the database or file system. You can hard code test data if needed.
- Final code should be properly commented and readable
